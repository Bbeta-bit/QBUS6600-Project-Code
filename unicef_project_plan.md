# UNICEF Australia Project Plan - Predicting Single-to-Regular Giver Conversion

**Detailed Task Timeline for 4-Person Team | 8 Weeks | Due: October 20**

---

## Project Understanding and Scope

This project requires you to build a classification model that predicts whether donors will convert from making single donations to becoming regular givers within six months of their first donation. The conversion occurs when donors purchase or subscribe to products with 'RG' in the product name. Your analysis must use only information available at the time of the first donation, making this a forward-looking prediction challenge rather than a retrospective analysis.

The business impact extends beyond academic exercise. UNICEF Australia operates in over 190 countries and territories, making efficient resource allocation critical for maximizing their impact on children's lives. Your model will directly influence how they prioritize marketing efforts, personalize donor communications, and ultimately increase their fundraising efficiency.

## Continuous Quality Assurance Throughout All Weeks

Understanding that successful project execution requires ongoing attention to quality and coordination, you should implement several practices consistently throughout your eight-week timeline. Schedule weekly team meetings at consistent times to review progress, address challenges, and ensure everyone stays aligned with project goals and timeline expectations. Each team member should regularly review others' work to catch errors early and maintain consistency across all project components.

Maintain clear documentation of all decisions including why you chose specific analytical approaches, how you handled data quality issues, and what business assumptions underlie your recommendations. This documentation serves multiple purposes including helping team members understand work they didn't directly perform and providing transparency for stakeholders who need to understand your methodology.

Build buffer time into your schedule for unexpected complications such as data quality issues that require additional cleaning, modeling challenges that necessitate trying different approaches, or technical difficulties that slow progress. Starting work early each week and completing tasks ahead of schedule reduces stress and improves final quality.

Establish clear communication protocols for sharing updates, asking for help, and making decisions that affect the entire project. Regular communication prevents small issues from becoming major problems and ensures all team members stay informed about project evolution and any changes to original plans.

This comprehensive task-by-task timeline provides the detailed structure you need to execute a successful project that demonstrates both technical competence and business acumen while delivering genuine value to UNICEF Australia and meeting all academic requirements.
